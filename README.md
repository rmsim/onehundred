# onehundred

Hello World!

Initial Goal: I'll be coding for a hundred days consecutively to practice coding on java. 

### Previous log: 
`001` HackNY - worked on thefoodpla.net
`002` HackNY - used my own github to demo, sadly, we didn't do anything with the API but showed our idea via a webpage which is essentially powerpoint 2.0... :(
`003` Coded on hackerrank;
`004` Reorganized thefoodplanet.zip into this onehundred folder; start to work on my own webpage (which tbh, is not as interesting as working on hackerrank right now)
`005` Completed all Intro problems for Java8 @ hackerrank
006: Started working on Java8 Strings @ hackerrank
007: Using Strings compareTo methods to sort strings (and substrings) lexicographically
008: Playing around with String methods to check for palindromes and anagrams
009: Learnt what Regex is and try to apply what I learnt on HackerRank
010: Attended an ADI session on collaborating on GitHub
011: Used pattern.compile and understood what it could do. Signed up for Regex contest & Women CodeSprint on Hackerrank
012: Do more problems on Hackerrank
013: Join AdInfinitum contest only to realize that the math problems are so much more difficult than the coding
014: Don't think I'll be REGEX queen anytime soon, but did the IntroTutorial question for the AdInfinitum contest on HackerRank
015: Did an inheritance problem on hackerrank
016: Did a try-catch problem on hackerrank
017:  Manage to spot my own mistake and make a little reminder to myself about Boolean ||; I also learn that there is a BigInteger class in Java today
018: Worked on another inheritance problem on hackerrank, not too sure why my own main method didn't run but the class was accepted and it worked on HackerRank
019: Working on Topological Sort for school
020: Made TopSort and implemented Dijkstra's Algo for school
021: CODESPRINT.... and lost my streak

## Back to my goal:

Try and fail again, and then try more and fail more.

Hello, I'm back!

### 001: Got started on LeetCode

I thought I had to write a main class too to check my output but turns out, the TwoSum question didn't care for that, they just want us to write the function. Good to know.
