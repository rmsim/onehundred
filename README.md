# onehundred

##Hello World!

Initial Goal: I'll be coding for a hundred days consecutively to practice coding on java. \\

Day 1: HackNY - worked on thefoodpla.net\\
Day 2: HackNY - used my own github to demo, sadly, we didn't do anything with the API but showed our idea via a webpage which is essentially powerpoint 2.0... :(\\
Day 3: Coded on hackerrank;\\
Day 4: Reorganized thefoodplanet.zip into this onehundred folder; start to work on my own webpage (which tbh, is not as interesting as working on hackerrank right now)\\
