# onehundred

Hello World!

Initial Goal: I'll be coding for a hundred days consecutively to practice coding on java. 

##Previous log: 
```
Day 1: HackNY - worked on thefoodpla.net

Day 2: HackNY - used my own github to demo, sadly, we didn't do anything with the API but showed our idea via a webpage which is essentially powerpoint 2.0... :(

Day 3: Coded on hackerrank;

Day 4: Reorganized thefoodplanet.zip into this onehundred folder; start to work on my own webpage (which tbh, is not as interesting as working on hackerrank right now)

Day 5: Completed all Intro problems for Java8 @ hackerrank
```


Day 6: Started working on Java8 Strings @ hackerrank<br \>
Day 7: Using Strings compareTo methods to sort strings (and substrings) lexicographically<br \>
Day 8: Playing around with String methods to check for palindromes and anagrams<br \>
Day 9: Learnt what Regex is and try to apply what I learnt on HackerRank<br \>
Day 10: Attended an ADI session on collaborating on GitHub<br \>
Day 11: Used pattern.compile and understood what it could do. Signed up for Regex contest & Women CodeSprint on Hackerrank.<br \>
Day 12: Do more problems on Hackerrank<br \>
Day 13: Join AdInfinitum contest only to realize that the math problems are so much more difficult than the coding<br \>
Day 14: Don't think I'll be REGEX queen anytime soon, but did the IntroTutorial question for the AdInfinitum contest on HackerRank<br \>
Day 15: Did an inheritance problem on hackerrank<br \>
Day 16: Did a try-catch problem on hackerrank<br \>
Day 17: Manage to spot my own mistake and make a little reminder to myself about Boolean ||; I also learn that there is a BigInteger class in Java today<br \>
Day 18: Worked on another inheritance problem on hackerrank, not too sure why my own main method didn't run but the class was accepted and it worked on HackerRank<br \>
Day 19: Working on Topological Sort for school<br \>
Day 20: Made TopSort and implemented Dijkstra's Algo. for school<br \>
Day 21: CODESPRINT<br \>
FINALS-HIATUS :( bye bye streak
